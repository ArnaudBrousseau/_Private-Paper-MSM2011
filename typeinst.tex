\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Google Chrome Extensions}
Google Chrome extensions\footnote{Google Chrome Extensions: \url{http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/index.html}. Text adapted from the description to be found there.} are small software programs that can be installed to enrich the browsing experience with the Google Chrome browser. They are written using a combination of standard Web technologies, such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Chrome extensions bundle all their files into a single file that gets usually (but not necessarily) distributed through the Chrome Web Store. There are several types of extensions, for this paper we focus on extensions based on so-called content scripts. Content scripts are JavaScript programs that run in the context of Web pages, similar to the Firefox Greasemonkey extension\footnote{Firefox Greasemonkey extension: \url{http://www.greasespot.net/}}. By using the standard Document Object Model (DOM), they can read or modify details of the Web pages a user visits. Examples of such modifications are, e.g., changing hyperlinks to remove potential @target="\_blank" attributes, or increasing the font size.

\subsection{Google Analytics}
 
\section{Twitter Swarm NLP Extension}
With our Twitter Swarm NLP extension\footnote{\url{https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dpbphenfafkflfmdlanimlemacankjol}}, we inject JavaScript code via a content script into the Twitter.com homepage. The extension first checks if the user is logged in, and if so, retrieves the tweets of the logged-in user's timeline one-by-one, and performs NLP analysis via a remote NLP Web service on each of the tweets. The extracted entities are then displayed on the righthand-pane of the Twitter.com homepage, and sent to Google Analytics for further processing.

\subsection{Twitter Swarm NLP Web Service}
We have created a wrapper NLP Web service that merges results from existing third-party NLP Web services, namely from OpenCalais\footnote{\url{http://www.opencalais.com/}}, Zemanta\footnote{\url{http://www.opencalais.com/}}, AlchemyAPI\footnote{\url{http://www.alchemyapi.com/}}, and DBpedia Spotlight\footnote{\url{http://dbpedia.org/spotlight}}.
